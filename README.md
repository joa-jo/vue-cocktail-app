## The App
**_"What was the name of the cocktail that I drank last time?"_**<br/>
The world of cocktails is huge, and it's too difficult to remember their names for me.<br/>
I got sick of trying to come up with them at a bar, thus I made this app.<br/>
Hopefully it enhances the quality of your drinking life as it did for mine. Cheers! :clinking_glasses:

## Features
- Login function for customizing cocktail-pick-list for each user.
- Search function for exploring the world of cocktail.
- Pick a cocktail function for saving your choice in firebase db.

## FYI
I have made this app with React before, but to practice Vue3.0 I converted it into Vue app.
