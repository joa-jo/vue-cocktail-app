## The App
**"What was the name of the cocktail that I drank last time?"**<br/>
The world of cocktails is huge and it's too difficult to remember their name for me.
I am sick of trying to remember their name at a bar, thus I made this app.
Hopefully this helps you to enjoy your drinking life too. Cheers! :clinking_glasses:

## Features
- Login function for customizing cocktail-pick-list for each user.
- Search function for exploring the world of cocktail.
- Pick a cocktail function for saving your choice in firebase db.

## FYI
I have made this app with React before, but to practice Vue3.0 I converted it into Vue app.
